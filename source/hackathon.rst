Hackathon Details
=================


Topic
---------------

Identifying extreme events (temperature, precipitation, and wind) in RAMIP data.

Timeline
--------

Get everyone set up on JASMIN beforehand and troubleshoot access on Wednesday. The hackathon will commence on Thursday afternoon following the Professional Development Workshop and will conclude with the wrap-up final analysis on Friday evening (tentative).

Expected Outcomes
-----------------

Our main goal will be to identify and catalog where, when, and why these extreme events have happened in a few different models. Future analysis can then be done with this catalog like identifying the aerosol influence on these extreme events.


Data Access
-----------

The data is stored on JASMIN under ``/gws/nopw/j04/terrafirma/RAMIP``.

Preparation
-----------

Please ensure you have the necessary tools and access rights installed and set up on your machine prior to the hackathon start. Details regarding system access (JASMIN training accounts) will be communicated in due course.
