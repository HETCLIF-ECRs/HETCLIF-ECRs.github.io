Introduction
------------

Welcome to the HETCLIF Early Career Researchers (ECRs) initiative, a central hub dedicated to fostering collaboration, sharing resources, and enhancing the research capabilities of ECRs involved in the HETCLIF project. 


Upcoming - ECR Workshop 2024
----------------------------

The purpose of this workshop is to create a comfortable research environment for ECRs involved with HETCLIF, encourage collaboration between both students and senior researchers, and promote professional development.

During this workshop, we plan to hold:

- **Aerosol Keynote Session:** We are happy to host Dr. Trude Storelvmo for an Aerosol Keynote Lecture to incorporate the scientific importance of our research into the workshop.

- **Student Symposium:** This will allow students to practice presenting their research in a low-stakes environment in front of other ECRs and to receive helpful feedback.

- **Professional Development Sessions:** Sessions focused on research communication, CV development, the peer review process, and scientific writing will be hosted by HETCLIF faculty and outside communications personnel.

- **Internal ECR Discussions:** Small discussions focused on plotting in Python, GitHub, time management, productivity, and other topics relating to ECR workflow will be incorporated between longer sessions.

- **Career Panel:** We are excited to host several HETCLIF faculty for a career panel discussion which will allow for ECRs to gain insight into various paths to success, or bumps faculty had along the way. Hosting faculty with a wide variety of backgrounds allows for comparison across academic research environments and highlights differences across countries.

- **Hackathon:** A hackathon analysis will allow for group collaboration amongst ECRs to: Identify extreme events (temperature, precipitation, and wind) in RAMIP data.

About HETCLIF
-------------

**Heterogeneous Climate Forcing (HETCLIF) - Linking Regional Perturbations to Climate Implications Across Multiple Scales:** How the climate responds to regional forcing is poorly known. Progress is hampered, in part, by limited observations, incomplete process understanding and poor model performance at regional scales, but even more by a lack of opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations. To address these issues, HETCLIF will co-locate and draw on the expertise and ongoing activities of world-leading researchers in aerosol forcing and regional feedback processes, advanced modeling, and atmosphere and ocean dynamics. Our key goal is to quantify the country-to-global scale implications of regional forcing through applications of dynamical theory, high and intermediate complexity modelling, and statistical pattern analysis. We will build on ongoing efforts to understand emerging and expected patterns of change in response to future heterogeneous forcing and develop a timely community approach for an emerging scientific discipline. `More information here <https://cas-nor.no/project/heterogeneous-climate-forcing-hetclif>`_.
